# ATLYSS Archipelago
This is a work-in-progress ATLYSS mod that allows the game to be randomized through [Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg). This mod has been tested to work on version 120206.a3 (currently the latest version).

# Install Instructions
1. Grab the latest mod and APWorld from the [Releases Page](github.com/AtlyssArchipelago/AtlyssArchipelago/releases/latest)
2. Install [Archipelago](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases/tag/0.6.6) if you haven't already. 0.6.0 or later is required.
3. Place `Atlyss.apworld` into Archipelago's `custom_worlds` folder.
4. [AP Version 0.6.5 or later] Use Archipelago's `Options Creator` button to make your .yaml.
5. [AP Versions below 0.6.5] Use Archipelago's `Generate Template Options` button, then edit `Atlyss.yaml` with the text editor of your choice.
6. Place your yaml into the Player's folder of your Archipelago install.
7. In the Archipelago Launcher, click `Generate`.
8. Go to Archipelago's [Host Game](https://archipelago.gg/uploads) page, and upload the newly created .zip in Archipelago's Output folder.
9. Click `Create New Room`.
10. Install the [latest version](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.23.4) of BepInEx 5.4.23, and extract it into the ATLYSS folder.

13. Launch ATLYSS and open the Settings menu.
14. Input the Archipelago server information into the Archipelago tab.
